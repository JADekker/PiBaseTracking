Let $H$ be a infinite-dimensional separable real Hilbert space (such
as the space $l^2$ of square-summable sequences) with inner product
$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$.  (All such spaces are isometrically
isomorphic.)  The continuous dual $H^*$ is the set of all linear
functionals $f : H \to \mathbb{R}$ that are continuous with respect to
the topology generated by the inner product.  By the Riesz
representation theorem, every such functional $f$ is of the form $f(x)
= \langle x, y \rangle$ for some $y \in H$.

The weak topology on the set $H$ is the coarsest topology such that
every element of $H^*$ is continuous.  That is, a basis for this
topology at $x \in H$ is the collection of all sets of the form $\{ y
\in H : |\langle y -x , x_i\rangle| < \epsilon, i = 1, \dots, n \}$
for some $x_1, \dots, x_n \in H$ and some $\epsilon > 0$.

See Definition 5.1.1 of {{doi:10.1007/978-93-86279-42-2}} or 28.16 of
{{doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-622760-4.X5000-6}}.  Note that the weak
topology on $H$ is homeomorphic to the weak-\* topology on $H^*$.
