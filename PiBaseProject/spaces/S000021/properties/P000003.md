Let $x \ne 0 \in H$.  Then the map $f(z) = \langle z, x \rangle$ is
continuous with respect to the weak topology and satisfies $f(0) = 0$
and $f(x) = \langle x,x \rangle > 0$.  So $0$ and $x$ are separated by
disjoint open sets.  It follows, since we are in a topological vector
space, that any two points $x,y$ are separated by disjoint open sets.
