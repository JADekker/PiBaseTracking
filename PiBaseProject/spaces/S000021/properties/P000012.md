Let $x$ be a point and $E$ a closed set with respect to the weak
topology.  Since we are in a topological vector space, we can assume
without loss of generality that $x = 0$.  By definition of the
topology, there exists a number $\epsilon > 0$ and finitely many
elements $x_1, \dots, x_n \in H$ such that the basic open set $U = \{ y :
|\langle y, x_i \rangle| < \epsilon, i = 1, \dots, n\}$ is disjoint
from $E$.  Note $0 \in U$.  Then the function $f(y) = \sum_{i=1}^n
|\langle y, x_i \rangle|$ satisfies $f(0) = 0$ and $f \ge \epsilon$ on
$E$.

See 26.30 of {{doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-622760-4.X5000-6}} for a more
general assertion that every topological vector space is completely
regular.
