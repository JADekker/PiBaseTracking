According to Theorem 27.17 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-4190-4}}, since
$H$ is infinite dimensional, no neighborhood of $0$ (or any other
point) is compact in the weak topology.  But every closed ball of the norm is
compact in the weak topology, by Alaoglu's theorem (5.2.1 of
{{doi:10.1007/978-93-86279-42-2}}), so every ball is nowhere dense.
And $H$ is a countable union of closed balls.
