By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem (see Theorem 5.2.1 of
{{doi:10.1007/978-93-86279-42-2}}), the closed unit ball (with respect
to the inner product of $H$) is compact in the weak-* topology, which
on a Hilbert space is equivalent to the weak topology.  Since $H$ is a
topological vector space, the same is true for every closed ball.  And
$H$ is a countable union of closed balls.
