Every infinite subset $A$ of $X$ contains a countably infinite subset $B$, which is
closed and discrete in $X$.  Since $B$ has no limit point, $A$ is not countably compact.
The countably compact subsets of $X$ are the finite sets, which are closed in $X$.

It is mentioned on p. 262 of {{doi:10.2307/2316017}} that $X$ is KC.
This is just a variation on that.
